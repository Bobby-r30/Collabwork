This will be a collaboration for a data project within the Professional Certifcate in Data Analytics at Imperial College.

My capstone (data project) aims to use machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for identifying coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, focusing on age and gender, utilising a dataset sourced from multiple sources and evaluating model performance with key metrics (Bobby Rahman).

My capstone data analytics project is about customer segmentation according to their demographic data, my main goal is to understand the factors that influence customer purchases and study their loyalty by applying machine learning algorithms such as clustering models (Ahlam Shaqfa).
